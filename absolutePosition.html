        <h2>1.Early life and education</h2>
        <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served 
            as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and 
            aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research
             and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
             space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development
             of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,
             and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
             <p>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as 
                a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. 
                He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.
                 After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, 
                Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, 
                Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where 
                he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study 
                aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.While Kalam was working
                 on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and
                 threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the
                 next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him,
                 <q>I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline</q>.
                 He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, 
                as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</p>
                <h2>2.Career as a scientist</h2>
                <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, 
                    Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the
                     Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, 
                    Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence
                     Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a
                     small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.
                    Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, 
                    the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space
                     Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first
                     Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite 
                    in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable
                     rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received the 
                    government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.
                    
                    
                    Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
                    In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center 
                    in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, 
                    Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s,
                     Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)
                     and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.</p>
